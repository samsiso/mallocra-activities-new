### Form Handling
- Use react-hook-form for complex forms
- Implement proper validation and error handling
- Create reusable form components

### Charts and Visualizations
- Use lightweight chart libraries (e.g., recharts)
- Implement responsive visualizations
- Use appropriate chart types for different data

### Security
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Validate all admin actions server-side
- Log all sensitive operations
- Implement rate limiting for admin APIs

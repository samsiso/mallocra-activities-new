# Progress Log - Baseline Audit 2025-01-25

## Summary
Initial audit and issue resolution for the mallocra-activities project.

## Issues Identified & Resolved

### ✅ Activity Routing Issue (FIXED)
**Issue**: Activity cards from landing page resulted in "page not found" errors

**Resolution**: 
- Updated activity detail page to use `getActivityBySlugSupabaseAction`

- Tested routing functionality successfully

### Development Status
- Server running on port 3000
- All slug-based activity URLs now functional

2. `app/(main)/activities/_components/activity-card.tsx` - Updated link routing

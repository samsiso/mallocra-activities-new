# 🗓️ Booking & Calendar System Research

## 📋 **RIPER Phase: Research**
**Date:** January 26, 2025  
**Objective:** Plan and design a comprehensive booking and calendar system for Mallorca Activities  
**Status:** Research Phase - Requirements Analysis

---

## 🎯 **Project Requirements Analysis**

### **Core Requirements**
1. **Calendar Date Selection** - Users can select preferred dates for activities
2. **Availability Checking** - Real-time integration with external providers  
3. **Booking Management** - Complete booking flow with confirmation
4. **Capacity Tracking** - Track and display available spots per date
5. **Provider Integration** - Check availability with partner companies

### **User Stories**
- **As a customer**, I want to see available dates for an activity so I can plan my trip
- **As a customer**, I want to see how many spots are left so I can book urgently if needed
- **As a provider**, I want to manage my availability calendar so bookings are accurate
- **As an admin**, I want to see all bookings and capacity so I can manage operations

## 🔍 **Technical Research**

### **Calendar Libraries (React/Next.js)**
| Library | Pros | Cons | Use Case |
|---------|------|------|----------|
| **React Calendar** | Lightweight, customizable | Basic features | Simple date selection |
| **React Big Calendar** | Full-featured, events display | Heavy, complex | Admin dashboards |
| **React DatePicker** | Great UX, time selection | Limited calendar view | Booking forms |
| **DayJS + Custom** | Full control, lightweight | More development time | Custom requirements |

**Recommendation:** React DatePicker for user-facing + React Big Calendar for admin

### **Availability Integration Patterns**
1. **Polling** - Check availability every few minutes
2. **Webhooks** - Real-time updates from providers
3. **API Gateway** - Centralized availability service
4. **Caching Layer** - Redis for performance

### **Database Design Considerations**
- **Bookings Table** - User bookings with status tracking
- **Availability Slots** - Time-based availability windows  
- **Capacity Rules** - Max people per activity/date
- **Provider Calendar** - External availability sync
- **Waiting Lists** - When activities are full

---

## 🏗️ **System Architecture Options**

### **Option A: Simple Internal System**
```
User → Calendar UI → Internal DB → Confirmation
```
**Pros:** Quick to build, full control  
**Cons:** Manual provider coordination

### **Option B: Provider API Integration**
```
User → Calendar UI → Provider APIs → Real-time Check → Booking
```
**Pros:** Real-time accuracy  
**Cons:** Dependent on provider APIs, complex error handling

### **Option C: Hybrid Approach**
```
User → Calendar UI → Cache Layer → Provider APIs + Internal Fallback
```
**Pros:** Best of both worlds, performance + accuracy  
**Cons:** Most complex to implement

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A, evolve to Option C

## 📊 **Database Schema Research**

### **Core Tables Needed**
```sql
-- Activities (existing)
activities: id, name, duration, max_capacity, price

-- Availability Calendar
availability_slots: 
  - id, activity_id, date, start_time, end_time
  - max_capacity, current_bookings, status

-- Bookings
bookings:
  - id, user_id, activity_id, availability_slot_id
  - booking_date, participants, status, payment_status
  - created_at, updated_at

-- Provider Integrations
provider_calendars:
  - id, provider_id, activity_id, external_calendar_id
  - sync_status, last_sync, api_endpoint

-- Waiting Lists
waiting_lists:
  - id, user_id, activity_id, preferred_date
  - created_at, notified_at, status
```

### **Status Enums**
- **Booking Status:** `pending`, `confirmed`, `cancelled`, `completed`
- **Availability Status:** `available`, `full`, `closed`, `maintenance`
- **Payment Status:** `pending`, `paid`, `refunded`, `failed`

---

## 🎨 **User Experience Research**

### **Booking Flow Analysis**
1. **Activity Selection** → Browse activities catalog
2. **Date Selection** → Interactive calendar with availability
3. **Time Slot Selection** → Available time slots for chosen date  
4. **Participant Details** → Number of people, special requirements
5. **Payment** → Secure payment processing
6. **Confirmation** → Booking confirmation with details

### **Calendar UX Best Practices**
- **Visual Indicators:** Green (available), Yellow (limited), Red (full), Gray (unavailable)
- **Quick Date Navigation:** Month/week views, jump to specific dates
- **Mobile Responsive:** Touch-friendly calendar for mobile users
- **Loading States:** Show availability checking in progress
- **Error Handling:** Clear messages when dates unavailable

---

## 🔌 **Integration Requirements**

### **Provider API Standards**
Most activity providers use:
- **CalDAV** - Standard calendar protocol
- **REST APIs** - Custom booking APIs  
- **Webhook Notifications** - Real-time updates
- **CSV/Excel Imports** - Manual availability updates

### **Payment Integration Points**
- **Pre-booking Hold** - Reserve spot during booking process
- **Instant Confirmation** - Immediate payment and confirmation
- **Deposit + Balance** - Partial payment now, rest later
- **Cancellation Handling** - Automatic refund processing

---

## 📈 **Scalability Considerations**

### **Performance Requirements**
- **Calendar Loading:** < 500ms for monthly view
- **Availability Check:** < 2s for real-time provider APIs
- **Booking Confirmation:** < 3s end-to-end
- **Concurrent Users:** Support 100+ simultaneous bookings

### **Data Volume Estimates**
- **10 Activities** × 365 Days × 5 Time Slots = 18,250 availability records/year
- **Expected Bookings:** 500-1000/month initially
- **Peak Season:** 3x normal booking volume

---

## 🚨 **Risk Analysis**

### **Technical Risks**
- **Provider API Reliability** - What if external APIs are down?
- **Double Bookings** - Race conditions during high demand
- **Data Sync Issues** - Availability mismatch between systems
- **Payment Failures** - Handling failed payments gracefully

### **Business Risks**  
- **Overbooking** - More bookings than actual capacity
- **No-shows** - Customers not showing up for booked activities
- **Seasonal Demand** - Massive spikes during peak tourist season
- **Provider Relationships** - Maintaining good API access

---

## 🎯 **Success Metrics**

### **Technical KPIs**
- **Booking Conversion Rate:** >15% (industry standard: 10-20%)
- **Calendar Load Time:** <500ms
- **API Error Rate:** <1%
- **Double Booking Incidents:** 0

### **Business KPIs**
- **Average Booking Value:** €75+ per booking
- **Customer Satisfaction:** >4.5/5 stars
- **Booking Completion Rate:** >90%

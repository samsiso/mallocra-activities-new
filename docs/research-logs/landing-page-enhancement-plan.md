## 2. üí° Video Background Implementation Plan

### 2.1 Video Selection Strategy
- **Primary Hero Video**: Aerial drone footage of Mallorca coastline or beaches (8-10 seconds)
- **Category Section Videos**: Shorter 3-5 second loops for each activity category:
  - Water sports: Sailing/kayaking gentle wave footage
  - Land adventures: Hiking/cycling through scenic mountain paths
  - Cultural tours: Historic sites with soft movement
  - Family activities: Playful beach or park scenes

### 2.2 Technical Specifications
1. **Video Format Requirements**:
   - MP4 format (primary), WebM (fallback)
   - Resolution: 1920√ó1080 (desktop), 720p (mobile fallback)
   - Compression: H.264 codec at 2-4Mbps
   - Duration: 8-10 seconds looped for hero, 3-5 seconds for sections
   - File size target: <2MB for hero, <1MB for section videos

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Preload attribute: `preload="metadata"` to avoid initial load delay
   - Lazy loading for secondary videos outside viewport
   - Mobile detection to serve static image fallbacks
   - Reduced frame rate options (24fps) for mobile
   - Video CDN delivery through existing Supabase storage

### 2.3 Visual Hierarchy Enhancement
- **Text Overlay Contrast**: Semi-transparent dark gradient overlay (rgba(0,0,0,0.4) to rgba(0,0,0,0.7))
- **Content Positioning**: Left-aligned text with breathing room from dynamic footage
- **Call-to-Action**: Prominent yellow buttons that stand out against video
- **Typography**: Larger hero text (3.5rem/56px) with increased letter spacing for better readability

### 2.4 Responsive Approach
- **Desktop**: Full video experience with high quality
- **Tablet**: Reduced resolution videos with optimized bitrate
- **Mobile**: Static image fallbacks with subtle CSS animations
- **Data-saving**: Option to disable videos with localStorage preference

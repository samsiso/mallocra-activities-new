## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Severity | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|-------------|----------|---------------------|
| Auth integration issues | High | Medium | High | Early testing with Clerk, have fallback auth plan |
| Calendar functionality complexity | Medium | High | High | Start early, use established libraries, consider simplifying MVP |
| Mobile responsiveness challenges | Medium | Medium | Medium | Mobile-first approach, regular testing on multiple devices |
| Performance issues with booking system | High | Medium | High | Load testing early, optimize database queries |
| API rate limits with external services | Medium | Low | Medium | Implement proper caching, have fallback functionality |
| Team resource constraints | High | Medium | High | Prioritize features, consider phased approach |

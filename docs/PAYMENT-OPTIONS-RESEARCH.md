- Manual payment confirmation workflow

### Admin Dashboard Integration
- Payment confirmation buttons
- Bank transfer reconciliation
- Manual payment tracking
- Customer notification system

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Implement modified cash payment method (1-2 hours)
2. **SHORT-TERM:** Research GoCardless integration requirements
3. **MEDIUM-TERM:** Implement automated bank transfer solution
4. **LONG-TERM:** Multi-gateway payment system

**Recommendation:** Start with the modified cash payment method for immediate demo, then implement GoCardless for production to achieve the lowest fees with automation.

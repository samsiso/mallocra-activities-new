## üí≠ **Key Insights from Research**

### **Client Requirements Clarity**
- **Primary Need:** Date selection calendar for activity bookings
- **Critical Feature:** Integration with external providers for availability
- **Business Logic:** Capacity tracking and booking management
- **Future Vision:** Real-time availability checking with partner companies

### **Technical Complexity Assessment**
- **UI Component:** Moderate complexity - calendar integration
- **Backend Logic:** High complexity - availability sync, booking management
- **Database Design:** Medium complexity - relational booking data
- **Integration Layer:** High complexity - external API coordination

### **Risk Mitigation Strategy**
- **Start Simple:** Internal availability management first
- **Iterate Quickly:** MVP with basic calendar, evolve to external integration
- **Fallback Plans:** Manual override capabilities for provider coordination
- **Performance Focus:** Caching layer essential for scalability

## üéØ **Strategic Decisions Made**

### **Technical Stack Recommendations**
1. **Calendar UI:** React DatePicker (user-facing) + React Big Calendar (admin)
2. **Database:** Extend existing Drizzle/Supabase setup
3. **Caching:** Plan for Redis integration in Phase 3
4. **Architecture:** Hybrid approach - internal + external API integration

### **Development Approach**
- **Phase 1:** Internal system with manual provider coordination
- **Phase 2:** Enhanced UX and booking flow optimization  
- **Phase 3:** External API integrations and advanced features

### **Database Schema Priority**
```sql
Priority 1: availability_slots, bookings (core functionality)
Priority 2: waiting_lists, provider_calendars (enhancement)
Priority 3: Advanced analytics and reporting tables
```

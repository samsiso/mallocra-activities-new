# Admin Sidebar UI/UX Refactor - Thought Log

## Date: 2025-01-25

### Context
- The admin dashboard sidebar was functional but lacked clear grouping, visual hierarchy, and polish.
- All admin pages use the same sidebar component, so a single update propagates everywhere.

### Goals
- Improve clarity and navigation by grouping related links.
- Add section headers for each group (Main, Management, Analytics, Settings).
- Make the active nav item more visually distinct (left border, accent background, indicator dot).
- Add branding (logo/avatar) above the admin label.
- Add a collapse/expand button for desktop users.
- Refine spacing, padding, and font sizes for readability.
- Ensure full dark theme compliance and responsive design.

### Design Decisions
- Used a `navigationGroups` array to group nav items and render section headers.
- Added a small logo/avatar circle and improved the "Mallocra Admin" label.
- Added a collapse/expand button (desktop only) to allow more screen space for content.
- Improved active state with a left border, background, and indicator dot.
- Footer now includes a user avatar and label, and adapts to collapsed state.
- All changes are fully responsive and accessible.

### Impact
- Navigation is now clearer and more visually appealing.
- Users can quickly find and access admin sections.
- Sidebar is consistent across all admin pages.
- Collapse/expand improves usability for power users.

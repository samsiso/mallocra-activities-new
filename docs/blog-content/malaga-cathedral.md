![Malaga Cathedral](/path/to/image.jpg)

Rising majestically above Malaga's historic center, the Cathedral of the Incarnation (Catedral de la Encarnación) stands as one of Andalusia's most impressive religious monuments. Affectionately known by locals as "La Manquita" (The One-Armed Lady) due to its conspicuously unfinished south tower, this architectural masterpiece represents over 250 years of construction and combines Renaissance, Baroque, and Gothic elements into a harmonious whole that tells the story not just of religious devotion but of Malaga's complex history.

This comprehensive guide explores the cathedral's fascinating history, architectural significance, artistic treasures, and practical visitor information to help you fully appreciate this essential landmark on any visit to Malaga.

## A Cathedral Born from a Mosque

### From Islamic to Christian Worship

The story of Malaga Cathedral begins not with its construction but with the building it replaced. Following the Christian Reconquest of Malaga in 1487, the city's main mosque was consecrated as a Christian church, as was common practice throughout Spain during the Reconquista. This improvised cathedral served the city for over thirty years while plans were developed for a grander structure worthy of Malaga's growing importance.

### The New Cathedral Project

In 1528, under the reign of Emperor Charles V, construction began on a new cathedral designed in the emerging Renaissance style. The ambitious project was laid out on the site of the former mosque, with initial plans drawn up by architect Diego de Siloé, one of Spain's leading proponents of the Renaissance style.

The first stone was laid by Bishop César Riario, and thus began a construction process that would span centuries, see multiple architects, survive earthquakes and economic crises, and ultimately remain unfinished to this day.

## Architecture: A Testament to Changing Tastes

What makes Malaga Cathedral particularly fascinating is how it embodies the evolution of architectural styles over the 250+ years of its construction (1528-1782). While primarily Renaissance in conception, the cathedral incorporates Gothic, Baroque, and Neoclassical elements that reflect the changing tastes and ideas of successive generations.

### The Renaissance Foundation

The cathedral's floor plan follows Renaissance ideals with:
- A Latin cross layout
- Three naves of equal height (creating a "hall church" or Hallenkirche design)
- A semicircular apse
- Harmonious proportions based on mathematical ratios

The initial design by Diego de Siloé emphasized clarity, symmetry, and classical elements inspired by Roman architecture.

### Gothic Influences

Despite its Renaissance conception, the cathedral retains several Gothic elements:
- Ribbed vaults in the ceiling
- Flying buttresses on the exterior
- Pointed arches in some sections

These features reflect the transitional period in Spanish architecture when Gothic traditions were gradually giving way to Renaissance innovations.

### Baroque Elaborations

As construction continued into the 17th and 18th centuries, Baroque elements were incorporated:
- The ornate choir stalls
- The elaborate facade with curved elements
- Richly decorated chapels
- The magnificent pipe organ

### The Distinctive Towers

Perhaps the most recognizable feature of Malaga Cathedral is its asymmetrical tower arrangement:
- The North Tower rises to a height of 84 meters (276 feet)
- The South Tower remains conspicuously unfinished at about half the intended height

This distinctive silhouette has given rise to the cathedral's nickname "La Manquita" (The One-Armed or One-Handed Lady).

## Why "The One-Armed Lady"?

One of the most frequently asked questions about Malaga Cathedral concerns its unfinished south tower. Several explanations exist for why construction was halted:

### The Historical Explanation

The most historically accurate explanation is financial. In 1782, construction funds were diverted to aid the American colonies in their war of independence against Great Britain. Work on the south tower ceased and was never resumed.

### The Popular Legend

Local legend offers a more colorful explanation: the money designated for completing the tower was used to fund the construction of the Central Highway to Antequera. When questioned about this diversion of funds, the city officials reportedly responded, "Obras pías fuera de la Iglesia también son obras de caridad" (Pious works outside the church are also works of charity).

### The Modern Perspective

Today, the cathedral's asymmetrical appearance has become so iconic that there is little public appetite for completing the tower. What began as an architectural compromise has become a beloved symbol of Malaga's identity.

## Artistic Treasures Within

The interior of Malaga Cathedral houses a remarkable collection of religious art and craftsmanship spanning several centuries.

One of the cathedral's most valuable artistic treasures is its choir, featuring:

Art historians consider these among the finest choir stalls in Spain.

## Practical Tips for White Village Day Trips

### When to Visit

- **Spring (March-May)**: Ideal time with pleasant temperatures and wildflowers blooming
- **Fall (September-November)**: Excellent weather with fewer tourists
- **Summer (June-August)**: Very hot but villages are often cooler than the coast due to elevation
- **Winter (December-February)**: Quietest period with cooler temperatures but still pleasant for sightseeing

### What to Bring

- **Comfortable walking shoes**: White villages feature steep, cobblestone streets

### Driving Tips

If renting a car (the most flexible way to explore):

- **Navigation**: Download offline maps as signal can be spotty in mountainous areas

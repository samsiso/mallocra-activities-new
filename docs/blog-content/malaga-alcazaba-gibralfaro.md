Towering above Malaga's skyline and offering breathtaking views of the Mediterranean, the Alcazaba fortress and Gibralfaro Castle stand as proud witnesses to the city's rich and diverse history. These magnificent structures not only provide stunning photo opportunities but also offer a fascinating journey through time, from the Roman era to the Moorish occupation and beyond.

## The Alcazaba: Malaga's Ancient Citadel

Built in the 11th century during the Moorish period, the Alcazaba (from Arabic al-qasbah, meaning "citadel") is one of the best-preserved moorish fortresses in Spain. While smaller than Granada's famous Alhambra, many visitors find Malaga's Alcazaba equally impressive and considerably less crowded.

### Historical Significance

The Alcazaba was built on the ruins of a former Roman fortification by the Hammudid dynasty in the early 11th century and later expanded by the Nasrid rulers. It served as both a defensive fortress and a palace for the city's governors.

What makes the Alcazaba particularly fascinating is how it incorporates elements from different periods:
- Roman columns and capitals repurposed in Moorish archways
- Remnants of the original Roman walls
- Islamic decorative elements and architecture
- Later Christian modifications

### What to See Inside the Alcazaba

The Alcazaba is divided into several sections, each worth exploring:

1. **The Entrance and Outer Walls**: The main entrance is through the Puerta de la Bóveda (Vault Gate), leading to a zigzagging path designed to make enemy attacks difficult.

2. **Plaza de Armas**: This courtyard features beautiful gardens, fountains, and orange trees.

3. **The Palaces**: The inner palace area includes:
   - Cuartos de Granada (Granada Chambers)
   - A series of peaceful courtyards
   - The Torre del Homenaje (Tribute Tower)
   - Beautiful horseshoe arches and decorative elements

4. **Archaeological Museum**: Located within the Alcazaba, this small museum displays artifacts found during excavations.

5. **The Views**: Throughout the fortress, you'll find spectacular viewpoints overlooking the city, port, and Mediterranean Sea.

## Gibralfaro Castle: The Guardian of Malaga

Perched even higher on Mount Gibralfaro is the Castle of Gibralfaro, built in the 14th century by Yusuf I of Granada to house troops and protect the Alcazaba. The name comes from the Arabic "Jabal-Faruk" (mountain of the lighthouse), referencing an ancient lighthouse that once stood there.

### What to See at Gibralfaro Castle

1. **The Ramparts**: Walking the complete circuit of the castle walls provides 360-degree panoramic views of Malaga and beyond. On clear days, you can even glimpse the coast of Africa.

2. **Military Museum**: Learn about the military history of the fortress through displays of weapons, uniforms, and historical information.

3. **The Airón Well**: This impressive 40-meter deep well was crucial for withstanding sieges.

4. **Main Courtyard**: Once filled with barracks, stables, and a mosque, the main courtyard gives a sense of life within the fortress.

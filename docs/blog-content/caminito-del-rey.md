For adventure seekers visiting Malaga, few experiences can match the exhilaration of hiking the Caminito del Rey. Once known as "the world's most dangerous walkway," this spectacular trail has been transformed from a crumbling hazard into one of Spain's most thrilling yet accessible adventures. Suspended along the steep walls of a narrow gorge, with walkways clinging to vertical cliffs hundreds of meters above the rushing Guadalhorce River, the Caminito del Rey offers an unforgettable combination of natural beauty, engineering marvel, and adrenaline-inducing heights.

This comprehensive guide will tell you everything you need to know about experiencing this unique attraction, from its fascinating history to practical tips for planning your visit from Malaga.

## What is the Caminito del Rey?

The Caminito del Rey (King's Little Path) is a walkway pinned along the steep walls of El Chorro gorge, about 60 kilometers northwest of Malaga city. The pathway stretches for 7.7 kilometers, with about 3 kilometers consisting of boardwalks attached to the near-vertical cliff faces.

At its most dramatic points, the walkway hangs 100 meters (330 feet) above the Guadalhorce River, offering breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. The path traverses three different canyons: the Gaitanejo Gorge, the Tajo de las Palomas, and the imposing El Chorro Gorge.

## A Brief History: From Perilous Utility to Tourist Attraction

### The Original Path

The original walkway was built between 1901 and 1905 to provide workers access to the hydroelectric power plants at Gaitanejo and El Chorro Falls. The path allowed maintenance workers to move between the plants and transport materials.

King Alfonso XIII walked the path in 1921 for the inauguration of the Conde del Guadalhorce Dam, giving the walkway its name: "The King's Little Path."

### The Dangerous Years

Over decades, the path fell into severe disrepair. Sections collapsed, handrails disappeared, and gaps in the concrete made crossing extremely dangerous. Despite (or perhaps because of) the danger, the path attracted thrill-seekers and climbers from around the world.

Following several fatal accidents, the path was officially closed in 2000. However, daring visitors continued to illegally access it, leading to more accidents and fatalities.

### The Restoration

Between 2014 and 2015, the pathway underwent a €5.5 million restoration. The dangerous sections were carefully rebuilt, safety features were added, and the path was transformed into a secure but still thrilling attraction. The renewed Caminito del Rey opened to the public in March 2015 and has since become one of Andalusia's most popular attractions.

## 📈 **MEDIUM PRIORITY TASKS**

### **Task AP-004: Fix Duplicate URL Images**
- **Issue**: All activity cards currently show the same URL images
- **Location**: Activity card image sources
- **Expected Outcome**: Each activity displays unique, real images from database
- **Technical Notes**: Verify database image fields, ensure proper image URL mapping
- **Effort**: Medium (database and image mapping)
- **Status**: 🔄 Pending

### **Task AP-005: Enhance Activity Card Information**
- **Issue**: Need more interesting information displayed on each activity card
- **Location**: Activity card content
- **Expected Outcome**: Cards display more engaging and informative content
- **Current Content**: Basic title, price, location
- **Potential Additions**: Rating stars, duration, difficulty level, highlights, availability status
- **Effort**: Medium (UI enhancement + data integration)
- **Status**: 🔄 Pending

---

## 💫 **NICE TO HAVE TASKS**

### **Task AP-006: Advanced Card Interactions**
- **Issue**: Cards could be more interactive and engaging
- **Expected Outcome**: Hover effects, quick preview functionality, better visual feedback
- **Effort**: Low (UI enhancement)
- **Status**: 🔄 Pending

### **Task AP-007: Performance Monitoring**
- **Issue**: Need metrics to track activities page performance improvements
- **Expected Outcome**: Performance dashboard for activities page load times and scroll performance
- **Effort**: Low (monitoring setup)
- **Status**: 🔄 Pending

---

## 🎯 **CURRENT PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED**

### **Performance Issues:**
- **Slow Scrolling**: Page scrolling performance is noticeably poor
- **Sluggish Lazy Loading**: 1+ second delay for cards to appear when scrolling fast
- **Poor User Experience**: Users have to wait for content to load

### **Data/Image Issues:**
- **Missing Image Validation**: Cards display without checking if images exist
- **Duplicate Images**: All cards showing same URL images instead of unique ones
- **Limited Card Content**: Cards don't display enough engaging information

### **User Experience Issues:**
- **Waiting for Content**: Sluggish loading creates poor UX
- **Generic Cards**: All cards look similar due to same images
- **Limited Information**: Cards could show more relevant details

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

### **For AP-001 (Scroll Performance):**
- Investigate CSS `transform3d`, `will-change` properties for cards
- Optimize scroll event handling and debouncing
- Check for unnecessary re-renders during scroll
- Implement virtual scrolling if needed for large datasets

### **For AP-002 (Lazy Loading Optimization):**
- Reduce intersection observer threshold for earlier loading
- Implement preloading for cards just outside viewport
- Optimize image loading pipeline
- Consider skeleton loading states for immediate feedback

### **For AP-003 (Image Validation):**
```javascript
// Implement image validation logic
const validateImage = (imageUrl) => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const img = new Image();
    img.onload = () => resolve(true);
    img.onerror = () => resolve(false);
    img.src = imageUrl;
  });
};
```

### **For AP-004 (Fix Duplicate Images):**
- Audit database image fields and mapping
- Ensure each activity has unique image URLs
- Implement proper image URL resolution from database
- Add fallback image system for missing images

### **For AP-005 (Enhanced Card Content):**
```jsx
// Enhanced card content structure
<ActivityCard>
  <Image />
  <Rating stars={activity.rating} reviews={activity.reviewCount} />
  <Title />
  <Duration time={activity.duration} />
  <Difficulty level={activity.difficulty} />
  <AvailabilityStatus />
  <Highlights tags={activity.highlights} />
  <PriceWithDiscount />
</ActivityCard>
```

## 📱 **MOBILE CONSIDERATIONS FOR ALL TASKS**

### **Mobile Performance (AP-001, AP-002):**
- Touch scrolling must be smooth and responsive
- Lazy loading optimized for mobile viewport changes
- Reduced resource usage for better battery life
- Touch-friendly card interactions

### **Mobile Card Layout (AP-005):**
- Ensure enhanced card content works on mobile screens
- Responsive design for additional information
- Touch targets meet accessibility guidelines
- Mobile-optimized image loading

## ⚡ **PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS**

### **Scroll Performance (AP-001):**
- Target: 60fps scrolling on desktop and mobile
- Maximum scroll lag: <16ms per frame
- Smooth scrolling even with 20+ cards visible

### **Lazy Loading (AP-002):**
- Target: Cards appear within 100ms of entering viewport
- Preload cards 200px before they enter viewport
- Maximum loading delay: 250ms

### **Image Loading (AP-003, AP-004):**
- Image validation: <500ms per image
- Fallback image display: Immediate
- Progressive image loading for better perceived performance

- **Availability Status**: Real-time availability or "Book Now"
- **Highlights**: 2-3 key features as tags
- **Price Display**: Clear pricing with any discounts

### **Visual Hierarchy:**
1. **Primary**: Activity image and title
2. **Secondary**: Rating and price
3. **Tertiary**: Duration, difficulty, highlights
4. **Action**: Book now button or availability status
